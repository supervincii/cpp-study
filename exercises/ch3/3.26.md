We wrote `mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2` instead of `mid = (beg + end) / 2` because `(end - beg)` are the remaining elements in the vector. If we do `beg + end` then we are adding the new `beg` which is `mid + 1` and `end` which is the whole length basically of the vector. It will lead to overflow.

There is also no `+` operator for iterators.
