```c++
vector<vector<int>> ivec;
vector<string> svec = ivec;
vector<string> svec(10, "null");
```

Which vector definitions are legal or illegal? Explain why.

- `vector<vector<int>> ivec;` **LEGAL**: defines that `ivec` is a `vector` that holds vectors of `int`
- `vector<string> svec = ivec;` **ILLEGAL**: `ivec` is a vector of vectors of int, `svec` is a vector of strings
  - Type does not match.
- `vector<string> svec(10, "null");` **LEGAL**: vector of 10 strings that have the value of `"null"`
