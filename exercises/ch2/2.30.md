Indicate whether the following declarations has top-level or low-level `const`.

```c++
int i;
const int v2; // top-level 
int v1 = v2; // top-level const in v2 is ignored

int *p1 = &v1, &r1  = v1; // no const

const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
// p2 low-level const as it points to a const int
// p3 top-level const
// r2 is low level
```
