`auto` deduces the type from the initializer, while `decltype` deduces the type from the type of its operand. 
Because `auto` deduces the type from the initializer, the declaration with `auto` should also be initialized. 
`decltype` however can be used as a specifier even if the expression is uninitialized.

Examples where `auto` and `decltype` deduces the same type:
```c++
int i = 123, j = 456;
auto x = i; // x = int
decltype(j) y = j; // y = int
```

Examples where `auto`and `decltype` deduces different types:
```c++
int i = 123, j = 456;
const int ci = i;
const int &cr = ci;

auto a = ci; // a = int
decltype(ci) b = ci; // b = const int (decltype preserves const)

auto c = i; // c = int
decltype((i)) d = i; // d = int& 
```
