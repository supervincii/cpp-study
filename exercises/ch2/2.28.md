```c++
// define i as an integer, cp is invalid as const needs to be attached to a type
int i, *const cp;
// p1 as an int, p2 is invalid as it needs to be attached to a type
int p1, const p2;
// ic as a const integer and r a reference to a const int (ic)
const int ic, &r = ic;
// p3 as a const pointer to a const int
const int *const p3;
// p as a pointer to a const int
const int *p;
