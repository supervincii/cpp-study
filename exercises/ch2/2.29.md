Using the variables from `2.28.md`, which of the following assignments are legal?

```c++
i = ic; 
// INVALID: `ic` should be initialized at the point of definition. If `ic` was initialized then it is legal.

p1 = p3; 
// INVALID: p1 is an int, p3 is a pointer

p1 = &ic; 
// INVALID: p1 is an int, &ic is a const int*

p3 = &ic; 
// INVALID: ic is uninitialized. If ic is initialized with an int value, and we declare p3 as `const int *const p3 = &ic` then it is valid

p2 = p1;
// VALID

ic = *p3;
// INVALID: p3 is uninitialized
// VALID ONLY IF:
// p3 was initialized with a value (not ic) and is defined to ic at declaration
// const int other = 10;
// const int *const p3 = &other;
// const int ic = *p3
// ic = 10 essentially
```
