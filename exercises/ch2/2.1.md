What are the differences between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short`? Between unsigned and a signed type? 
Between a `float` and a `double`?

1. `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short` are all signed integers that differ on how many bytes they can occupy, which 
in turn defines how large/small a number they can represent. 

| Type        | Minimum Size | Minimum Number Range            |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `int`       | 16 bits      | -32767 ~ +32767                 |
| `long`      | 32 bits      | -2,147,483,647 ~ +2,147,483,647 | 
| `long long` | 64 bits      | -9.22 * 10^18 ~ +9.22 * 10^18   |
| `short`     | 16 bits      | -32767 ~ +32767                 |

2. Signed types represents negative or positive numbers, including zero. Unsigned types represents only values 
   greater than or equal to zero.
3. `float` is represented in 6 significant digits (usually 32 bits) and `double` is represented in 15 significant 
   digits (64 bits).
