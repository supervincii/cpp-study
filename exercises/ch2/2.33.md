const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci; // b is an `int` (top level `const` in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr; // `c` is an `int` (`cr` is an alias for `ci` whose `const` is top-level)
auto d = &i; // d is an `int*` (`&` of an `int` object is `int*`)
auto e = &ci; // `e` is a `const int*` (`&` of a `const` object is a low-level `const`)
const auto f = ci; // `f` is a `const int`
auto &g = ci; // `g` is a const int& that is bound fo ci;

a = 42; // VALID: a is an `int`
