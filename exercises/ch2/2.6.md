```c++
int month = 9, day = 7;
```
The code above declares two variables, `month` & `day`, both initializing its values to a *decimal* `int`.

```c++
int month = 09, day = 07;
```
The code above declares two variables, `month` & `day`, both initializing its values to an *octal* `int`.
This however will fail to compile because `09` is not a valid octal number (should be in the range of 0 - 7).
